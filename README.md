# GitHub Collobration Practice

This document outlines the collaborative steps for updating an HTML file using GitHub and VS Code.

## Project Objective
Create an HTML page that displays a title, a list of five items, and relevant images, all styled with an external CSS file.

## Team Collaboration Steps

### 🧑‍💻 Member 1: Set Up the HTML Structure
- Add a `<h1>` tag inside the `<body>`.
- Assign a relevant title to the `<h1>` (e.g., "Top 5 Favorite Foods/Movie/Album/Celebrity etc").
- Commit and push changes to GitHub.

### 🧑‍💻 Member 2: Add an Unordered List
- Pull the latest version of `index.html`.
- Below the `<h1>`, add an unordered list (`<ul>`) with 5 relevant items (`<li>` elements).
- Ensure the items are relevant to the title.
- Commit and push changes.

### 🧑‍💻 Member 3: Add Images
- Find 5 images that match each item in the unordered list.
- Download the images and store them in the project folder (e.g., `/images`) in your VS Code project.
- Use `<img>` tags within each `<li>` to display the images.
- Commit and push the changes.

### 🧑‍💻 Member 4: Add and Link CSS
- Create a new CSS file (`style.css`) in the project folder.
- Add basic styles (e.g., font, colors, layout).
- Link the CSS file to `index.html` using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>`.
- Commit and push the final changes.

### 🧑‍💻 Member 1 - 4: Update the CSS
- Apply different styles
- Color the text
- Width and height to images and div


## Tips
- Communicate often and clearly with team members.
- Use pull requests for review before merging.
- Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
